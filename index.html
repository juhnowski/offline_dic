    <h1>How to install</h1>
    At first time and only once you need to open html with incapsulated javascript for creating dictionary.<br>
    Now there is only one dictionary:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="wil.html">Wilson Sanskrit-English Dictionary</a></li>
    </ul>
    Please be patient. Filling of the database is low-priority asynchronous process for the browser. Approximately it takes several minutes.<br>
    To be convinced that the database was successfully created click F12 and then go to the Application tab: Web SQL -> mydb -> DICT

    <h1>How to create dictionary</h1>
    Dictionary html files with incapsulated javascript are converted by java app <a href="https://github.com/juhnowski/Xml2JS">Xml2JS</a>

    <h1>How to use</h1>
    <h2>Open <a href="fetching.html">fetching.html</a> print word in input box and press Enter.<br></h2>
    Settings works only for online version.<br>
    It was tested in Google Chrom 58.0.3029.110 (64-bit).<br>
    If you want to use it in mobile browser there are two way:
    <ul>
      <li>put files in public folder of webserver (for instance Apache, IIS, Nginx, Python Simple HTTP server ...)</li>
      <li>transfer it to mobile file system some way (by USB, or by e-mail) and then open it in chrome mobile browser</li>
    </ul>
    It's expected that it will be worked in browsers:
    <ul>
      <li>Chromium</li>
      <li>Firefox</li>
    </ul>

  <h1>TODO</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Create browser plugin for Google Chrome</li>
    <li>Investigate Safari and IE capabilities</li>
    <li>Convert all dictionaries from <a href="http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/">Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionaries</a></li>
  </ul>
